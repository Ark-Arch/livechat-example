# Full-stack livechat example

This repository contains a [slack](https://slack.com) clone made with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/), and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

The main objective of this project for me here is to get accustomed with the practices of Continous Integration in a devOps environment.

I intend to take on activities centered around pull request automation.
